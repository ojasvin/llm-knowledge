# Understanding the Architecture of Large Language Models: Decoding Strategies in Language Models - Beam Search, Top-K, and Top-P Sampling

Decoding strategies such as Beam Search, Top-K, and Top-P Sampling are integral to the generation of high-quality, varied, and logical text from large language models. These strategies guide the model through the myriad of possible outputs it could generate, striking a balance between creating varied text (exploration) and creating high-probability text (exploitation).

## Decoding Strategies: An Overview

Large language models predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous words. This task is not as straightforward as selecting the word with the highest probability, as this approach can lead to repetitive and illogical text. Therefore, decoding strategies are employed to maintain a balance between diversity and quality.

Decoding strategies find their application in various language model applications, such as machine translation, text summarization, and chatbots. The three primary decoding strategies are Beam Search, Top-K Sampling, and Top-P Sampling.

### Beam Search

Beam Search enhances the logicality and grammatical correctness of sentences by tracking multiple potential sentences (the 'beams') at each step, rather than just the best one. Beam Search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores the most promising nodes. For instance, consider a language model predicting the next word in the sentence "The cat is on the". The model might consider "roof", "ground", and "tree" as potential next words. With Beam Search, instead of just choosing the most probable next word, it keeps track of several possible sentences (beams). If we set the beam width to 2, it will keep "The cat is on the roof" and "The cat is on the ground" as potential sentences. It then calculates the probability of all possible next words for each of these sentences and keeps the top 2. This process continues until the end of the sentence is reached.

### Top-K Sampling

Top-K Sampling introduces randomness to text generation by choosing the next word from the top K most likely words, not just the most probable one. This strategy creates more varied text. The value of K affects the diversity and quality of the output. If K is small, the model will only choose from a small set of words, which might make the output less diverse but more focused. If K is large, the model has more words to choose from, which can increase diversity but might also include less probable (and potentially nonsensical) words. For example, if K=3 for the sentence "The cat is on the", the model might only consider "roof", "ground", and "tree" as next words. If K=10, it might also consider less likely words like "book", "car", or "apple".

### Top-P Sampling

Top-P Sampling, or nucleus sampling, goes a step further by choosing the smallest group of top words whose combined probability is over a threshold P. This strategy balances between diversity (like Top-K) and quality (like Beam Search). The threshold P represents a cumulative probability. The model selects the smallest set of words whose combined probability exceeds this threshold. The choice of P affects the diversity and quality of the output. A smaller P means the model will only consider very probable words, making the output less diverse but potentially more coherent. A larger P increases diversity but might also include less probable words. For example, if P=0.9 for the sentence "The cat is on the", the model might consider all words whose combined probability is 0.9 or more, which could include "roof", "ground", "tree", and potentially less likely words until the cumulative probability threshold is reached.

In conclusion, decoding strategies are crucial in controlling the balance between diversity and quality in the text generated by large language models. The choice of strategy depends on the specific needs of the application.
